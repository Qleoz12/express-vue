# TODO

- [] Link to sub readmes in main readme
- [] Refactor/simplify any BE code
- [] Write updated tests for all BE/FE and reformat test layout (deps first) (do we still need __mocks__ folders?)
- [] Make sure all NPM `script` commands are defined for build process.
- [] Update README with any command changes
- [] Try out Typescript
