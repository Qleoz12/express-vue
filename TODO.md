# TODO

- [] Finish up notifications and errors components/composables
  - See if we can use the error composable outside of vue code like in a service
  - Add logging to errors composable and make use of notifications composable to show error
- [] Implement a `js/modules` folder with an example of using composition API
- [] Add basic vuex store pattern for handling loading/errors
- [] Refactor/simplify any BE code
- [] Write updated tests for all BE/FE and reformat test layout (deps first) (do we still need __mocks__ folders?)
- [] Make sure all NPM `script` commands are defined for build process.
- [] Update README with any command changes
