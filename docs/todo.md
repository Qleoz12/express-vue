# TODO

- [] Instead of trully mocking `store`, try creating utility that returns an actual store that can be updated.
- [] Show example of a computed prop / getter via store
- [] Write updated tests for FE
- [] Write updated tests for BE
- [] Merge to master
- [] Keep an eye on Vetur's experimental template interpolation. Currently it's unusable due to this issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/2668
