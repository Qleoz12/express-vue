# TODO

- [] Typescript FE
- [] Typescript BE
- [] Is there a better alternative to Vee Validate?
- [] Think about having .env file example for secrets
- [] Write updated tests for all FE (Typescript?)
- [] Write updated tests for all BE (Typescript?)
- [] Update README with any command changes
  - `modules-and-mocking.md` would change if BE is using Typescript ES6 module syntax
- [] Keep an eye on Vetur's experimental template interpolation. Currently it's unusable due to this issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/2457
