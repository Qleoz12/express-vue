# TODO

- [X] Use Vite for FE
- [X] Typescript FE
- [X] Typescript BE
- [] Don't pass around `res` object in BE services (auth mainly) - should split that out to helpers if needed for setting cookies, etc
- [] Create FE sign in page and register page
- [] Create FE session auth load method to refresh tokens if signed in
- [] Support Vue Dev tools (manual enable for v3?)
- [] Nice error page served from BE using styles index.html with template renderer (ERB)?
- [] Can FE code be made simpler or improved?
- [] https://medium.com/@mario.brendel1990/vue-3-the-new-store-a7569d4a546f
- [] Write updated tests for all BE (Typescript?)
- [] Is there a better alternative to Vee Validate?
- [] Write updated tests for all FE (Typescript?)
- [] Update README with any command changes
- [] Keep an eye on Vetur's experimental template interpolation. Currently it's unusable due to this issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/2668
